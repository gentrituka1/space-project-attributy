# Space Project Attributy

Space Project Attributy is a project that uses the SpaceX API.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install the modules.

```bash
npm install
```
or 
```bash
npm i
```
for both the frontend and backend folders.
## Usage

In order to start the backend server, simply go the backend folder and write:
```bash
nodemon index.ts
```
or 
```bash
ts-node index.ts
```
Caution! If you don't have either ts-node or nodemon, simply install it by simply writing:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```
and for nodemon:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

As for the frontend part, simply go to the frontend folder and write in the command line:
```bash
npm run dev
```

And if you are getting "script" errors or similar, try this:
- Start a new powershell as an admin
- Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Then try again.
